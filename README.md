The project was created with the purpose of providing a better understanding of RESTful API development. Initially, a simple todo list project was built using the SpringBoot framework. This project included a Controller class that implemented all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), allowing for easy management of todo items.

The next step in the project involved transforming the Controller class to adhere to RESTful architecture principles. This involved designing RESTful endpoints that allowed for efficient handling of server requests and responses, improving the user experience.

`Java` was the primary language utilized throughout the project, with additional knowledge of `Spring MVC` and  `Ajax`.

Overall, this project serves as an excellent example of how to build a robust RESTful API using modern software development practices, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying principles that govern API design and implementation.
