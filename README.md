# RESTful - A simple Spring MVC todo list with RESTful api development

## About This Project

The project was created with the purpose of providing a better understanding of RESTful API development. Initially, a simple todo list project was built using the SpringBoot framework. This project included a Controller class that implemented all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), allowing for easy management of todo items.

The next step in the project involved transforming the Controller class to adhere to RESTful architecture principles. This involved designing RESTful endpoints that allowed for efficient handling of server requests and responses, improving the user experience.

`Java` was the primary language utilized throughout the project, with additional knowledge of `Spring MVC` and  `Ajax`.In addition, the use of software `Postman` to test the RESTful endpoints
