# RESTful - A simple Spring MVC todo list with RESTful api development

## About This Project

The project was created with the purpose of providing a better understanding of RESTful API development. Initially, a simple todo list project was built using the SpringBoot framework. This project included a Controller class that implemented all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), allowing for easy management of todo items.

The next step in the project involved transforming the Controller class to adhere to RESTful architecture principles. This involved designing RESTful endpoints that allowed for efficient handling of server requests and responses, improving the user experience.

`Java` was the primary language utilized throughout the project, with additional knowledge of `Spring MVC` and  `Ajax`.In addition, the use of software `Postman` to test the RESTful endpoints

## Curriculum design
This project can be used as a curriculum design for, for example, **three hours to learn RESTful style software design**.

I have given an syllabus below:
Course Overview:

This course is designed for developers who want to learn how to create a RESTful API using SpringBoot framework. The course will cover the basics of creating a simple Todo list project and adapting its main controller class to use RESTful style.

Course Outline:

- Introduction to RESTful APIs
1. What is API?
  An API (Application Programming Interface) is a number of predefined functions, or conventions for interfacing different components of a software system. The purpose is to provide applications and developers with the ability to access a set of routines based on a piece of software or hardware, without having to access the original code or understand the details of the internal workings.
2. What is a RESTful API?
